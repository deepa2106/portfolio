## Portfolio

Brief:
I have created a portfolio which uses a small amount of bootstrap and responsive CSS. I have included 3 sections:
  * About
  * Skills
  * Experience
This is followed by a footer which includes contact links.

I had a lot of difficulty in trying to get the nav bar to stay fixed to the top no matter where you scroll down to on the page. It caused problem in the scrolling too as it would end up scrolling to a section and the start of the section would show up underneath the nav bar.

I am personally most pleased with the usage of responsive CSS as the contents resize without any problems in the layout and positions.
